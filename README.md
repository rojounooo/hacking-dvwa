# DVWA Testing Documentation

This repository contains my walkthrough and notes while testing Damn Vulnerable Web Application, a deliberately insecure PHP app for learning about web vulnerabilities.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To understand how each vulnerability behaves at different security levels: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**, and **Impossible**.

---

## 📂 Structure

The documentation is organized by vulnerability, e.g. SQL Injection, Brute Force and File Upload. Each directory will contain a vulnerabilty_overview.md, explaining what the attack it and how it is exploited as well as an analysis of the insecure code. It will also include my methodology for the different levels:

- **Low** – Minimal or no protection.
- **Medium** – Basic input validation or filters.
- **High** – More sophisticated protections.
- **Impossible** – Secure implementations.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- VirtualBox
- Kali Linux 
- Ubuntu Server 
- DVWA

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for **educational purposes only**. Do not attempt to exploit systems you don’t own or have explicit permission to test.
