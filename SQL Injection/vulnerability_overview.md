# Vulnerability: SQL Injection


## What is SQL Injection?

- An vulnerability that allows an attacker to modify queries an application makes to it's database. This allows an attacker to view data they normally cannot, such as passwords. It can also be used to sign into accounts without using the password at all. 

- Targets include: 
    - Login forms 
    - Search Boxes 
    - URL Query Strings
    - Contact Forms 

- Common techniques used are:
    - **'---'** is used to comment out sections of the queries to allow hidden data to be retrieved. 

    -**OR 1=1** is a boolean value used to retrieve hidden information because the value is always true. However this condition can be harmful as it can be used in an UPDATE or DELETE query resulting in loss of data. 

    -**' UNION SELECT** is used to get extra data from other tables in the database by executing an additional SELECT query.

- Real world examples include:
    - Heartland Payment Systems (2008):
        - Over 130 million credit and debit card numbers were compromised
    
    - Sony PlayStation Network (2011):
        - Data theft of approximately 77 million accounts
    
    - Foxtons Group (2020):
        - A data breach resulting in 16000 customer records being exposed, including sensitive financial data
