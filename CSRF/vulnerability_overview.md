# Vulnerability: CSRF

---

## What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?

- CSRF is also known as:
    - XSRF
    - Sea Surf

- Allows attackers to trick a userâ€™s browser into sending unintended requests to a trusted website where the user is already authenticated
- Exploits the fact that browsers automatically include cookies and authentication tokens with requests to the same origin
- Can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user without their knowledge

- Typical targets include:
    - Web applications with authenticated user sessions
    - Banking and financial platforms
    - Social media sites
    - Account management portals

- Common techniques used are:
    - Hidden HTML forms that auto-submit
    - Image or script tags pointing to sensitive endpoints
    - Cross-site `<iframe>` requests
    - JavaScript-triggered requests (if CORS or headers allow)

- Real world examples include:
    - Gmail (2008):
        - Attackers exploited a CSRF flaw to auto-create malicious email filters in victim accounts
    - Netflix (2014):
        - Vulnerability allowed attackers to change user login credentials via crafted CSRF requests
