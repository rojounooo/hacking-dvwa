# Vulnerability: Brute Force

## What is Brute Force?

A **Brute Force Attack** is a method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a system by systematically guessing passwords or encryption keys. It relies on the idea of trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found.

1. The attacker identifies a login form or protected resource.
2. They use a tool or script to automatically and repeatedly try different username and password combinations.
3. If rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms are not in place, the attacker can keep trying until they succeed.
4. Once the correct credentials are found, the attacker gains access.

Brute force attacks can be:
- **Online**: Directly against a live login form
- **Offline**: Against stolen password hashes or encrypted files
