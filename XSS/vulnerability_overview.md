# Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

## What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?

- A vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. These scripts are executed in the victim's browser, enabling attackers to steal data, impersonate users, or perform actions on their behalf.

### Targets include:
- Comment sections  
- Search boxes  
- User profile fields  
- URL parameters  

### Common techniques used are:
- **`<script>alert('XSS')</script>`**  
  Injects a script that runs when the page loads, commonly used to demonstrate a basic XSS vulnerability.

- **`<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`**  
  Uses a broken image with an `onerror` event to run JavaScript when the image fails to load.

- **`document.cookie`**  
  Allows attackers to access cookies stored in the browser, often used to hijack user sessions.

### Real world examples include:
- **MySpace (2005):**  
  Samy worm used an XSS flaw to add over 1 million friends in a single day by propagating itself across user profiles.

- **eBay (multiple incidents):**  
  Attackers embedded XSS in product listings to redirect users to phishing sites or execute malicious code.

- **British Airways (2018):**  
  Magecart attackers injected malicious scripts on the payment page, stealing credit card data of over 380,000 customers.
