# Vulnerability: Brute Force

## What is a Brute Force Attack?

- A vulnerability where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access by systematically guessing credentials such as usernames or passwords. This is done using automated tools that try many combinations until the correct one is found.

- Targets include:
    - Website login forms  
    - Admin panels  
    - Email accounts  
    - SSH/FTP services  
    - Encrypted files or ZIP archives  
- Common techniques used are:
    - **Simple brute force**  
    Tries every possible combination of characters (e.g., `aaaa`, `aaab`, `aaac`, ...).

    - **Dictionary attack**  
     Uses a list of commonly used passwords such as `123456`, `password`, or `letmein`.

    - **Credential stuffing**  
    Uses previously leaked username/password pairs from other data breaches.

    - **Reverse brute force**  
    Takes one common password (e.g., `123456`) and tries it against many different usernames.

- Real world examples include:
    - **LinkedIn (2012):**  
    Over 6.5 million password hashes were leaked and many were cracked using brute force due to weak hashing algorithms.

    - **Adobe (2013):**  
    Attackers stole encrypted passwords for millions of users, many of which were brute-forced due to poor encryption practices.

    - **Microsoft Office 365 (2020):**  
    Widespread credential stuffing and brute force login attempts were reported, targeting enterprise accounts across the platform.
